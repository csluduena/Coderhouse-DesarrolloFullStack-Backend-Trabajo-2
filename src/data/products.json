    "descripcion": "The Gibson SG was born in 1961 and since then it has become a staple throughout the world of popular music. Its double cutaway means that access to the highest frets is easy and its thinner body means that it’s lighter too (compared to a Les Paul). The Gibson SG Standard 2016 T is a nod back to the SGs of the 60s and we, here at Reidys, really like it.",
